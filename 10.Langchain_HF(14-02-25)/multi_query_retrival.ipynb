Substances such as barbiturates, morphine derivatives, and hallucinogens such as mescaline were employed in experiments conducted on Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Jewish, and other nationalities\\' prisoners of war. The aim of these experiments was to develop a truth serum which would, in the words of one laboratory assistant to Dachau scientist Kurt Plötner, \"eliminate the will of the person examined\". American historian Stephen Kinzer said that the CIA project was a continuation of these earlier Nazi experiments, as evidenced by MKUltra\\'s use of mescaline on unwitting subjects, which had previously been done by Nazi scientists in Dachau.\\nAmerican interest in drug-related interrogation experiments began in 1943, when the Office of Strategic Services began developing a \"truth drug\" that would produce \"uninhibited truthfulness\" in an interrogated person. In 1947, the United States Navy initiated Project CHATTER, an interrogation program which saw the first testing of LSD on human subjects.\\nIn 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency under the direction of general Walter Bedell Smith initiated a series of interrogation projects involving hum'),\n",

Marion Sims, who is often referred to as \"the father of gynecology,\" performed surgical experiments on infants, enslaved African women, and girls as young as 13 without anesthesia for the treatment of conditions including vesicovaginal fistula, Neonatal tetanus, and other similar conditions. The patients—one of whom was operated on 30 times—suffered from infections and many failed surgeries before they were finally cured of vaginal fistula. The period between 1845 and 1849 during which Sims operated on enslaved women was one during which the new practice of anesthesia was not universally accepted as safe and effective.\\nIn 1874, Mary Rafferty, an Irish servant woman, came to Dr. Roberts Bartholow of the Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio for treatment of a lesion on her head. The lesion was diagnosed as a cancerous ulcer and surgical treatments were attempted. Bartholow saw Rafferty\\'s condition as terminal but felt there was a research opportunity. He inserted electrode needles into her exposed brain matter to gauge her responses. This was done with no intention of treating her. Although Rafferty came out of the coma caused by the experiment three days later, she died from a massive seizure the following day. Bartholow described his experiment as follows:\\n\\nWhen the needle entered the brain substance, she complained of acute pain in the neck. To develop more decided reactions, the strength of the current was increased ... her countenance exhibited great distress, and she began to cry.

He received an M.B., Ch.B. in psychological medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1924, a D.P.M. from the University of London in 1925, and an M.D. with distinction from the University of Glasgow in 1936.\\nCameron began his training in psychiatry at the Glasgow Royal Mental Hospital in 1925. In 1926, he served as assistant medical officer there and was introduced to psychiatrist Sir David Henderson, a student of Swiss-born US psychiatrist Adolf Meyer. He continued his training in the United States under Meyer at the Phipps Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland from 1926 to 1928 with a Henderson Research Scholarship.\\nIn 1928, Cameron left Baltimore for the Burghölzli, the psychiatric hospital of the University of Zurich, in Switzerland, where he studied under Hans W. Maier, the successor of Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had significantly influenced psychiatric thinking. There he met A. T. Mathers, Manitoba's principal psychiatrist, who convinced Cameron in 1929 to move to Brandon, the second largest city of Manitoba, Canada. Cameron stayed there for seven years and was made physician-in-charge of the Reception Unit of the Provincial Mental Hospital. He also organized the structure of mental health services in the western half of the province, establishing 10 functioning clinics; this model was used as the blueprint for similar efforts in Montreal and a forerunner of 1960s community health models.\\nIn 1933, he married Jean C. Rankine, whom he had met while they were students at the University of Glasgow. She was a former captain of the Scottish field hockey team, a competitive tennis player, and lecturer in mathematics at the University of Glasgow. They had four children; a daughter and three sons.\\nIn 1936, he moved to Massachusetts to become director of the research division at Worcester State Hospital only 1 year later. In 1936, he also published his first book, Objective and Experimental Psychiatry which introduced his belief that psychiatry should approach the study of human behavior in a rigorous, scientific fashion rooted in biology. His theories of behavior stressed the unity of the organism with the environment; the book also outlined experimental method and research design. Cameron believed firmly in clinical psychiatry and a strict scientific method.\\nIn 1938 he moved to Albany, New York, where he received his diplomate in psychiatry and thus was certified in psychiatry.

Prisoners were forced into participating; they did not willingly volunteer and no consent was given for the procedures. Typically, the experiments resulted in death, trauma, illness, shortening of life, disfigurement, or permanent disability, and as such are considered as examples of medical torture since the participants had to endure mass amounts of pain.\\nAt Auschwitz and other German camps, under the direction of Eduard Wirths, selected inmates were subjected to various hazardous experiments that were designed to help German military personnel in combat situations, develop new weapons, aid in the recovery of military personnel who had been injured, and to advance the racial ideology backed by the Third Reich. Aribert Heim conducted similar medical experiments at Mauthausen. At Buchenwald, Carl Værnet conducted experiments on homosexual prisoners in an attempt to \"cure\" homosexuality.\\nAfter the war, these crimes were tried at what became known as the Doctors\\' Trial, and the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics. During the Nuremberg Trials, 23 Nazi doctors and scientists were tried for the unethical treatment of concentration camp inmates, who were often used as research subjects with fatal consequences. Of those 23, 16 were convicted (15 were convicted for the unethical treatment, while one of them was only convicted of SS membership), 7 were condemned to death, 9 received prison sentences from 10 years to life, and 7 were acquitted.\\n\\n\\n=== Before World War II ===\\nThe Law for the Prevention of Genetically Defective Progeny, passed on 14 July 1933, legalized the involuntary sterilization of persons with diseases claimed to be hereditary: weak-mindedness, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, insanity, blindness, deafness, and physical deformities. The law was used to encourage growth of the Aryan race through the sterilization of persons who fell under the quota of being genetically defective. 1% of citizens between the age of 17 to 24 had been sterilized within two years of the law passing. Within four years, 300,000 patients had been sterilized. From about March 1941 to about January 1945, sterilization experiments were conducted at Auschwitz, Ravensbrück, and other places by Carl Clauberg. The purpose of these experiments was to develop a method of sterilization which would be suitable for sterilizing millions of people with a minimum of time and effort. These experiments were conducted by means of X-ray, surgery and various drugs. Thousands of victims were sterilized. Aside from its experimentation, the Nazi government sterilized around 400,000 people as part of its compulsory sterilization program. Intravenous injections of sol'),\n",

His older brother was plant biologist David Gottlieb. A stutterer since childhood, he earned a master\\'s degree in speech therapy from San Jose State University after retiring from the CIA. He was born with a club foot, which got him rejected from military service in World War II but did not prevent his pursuit of folk dancing, a lifelong passion.\\nGottlieb graduated from James Monroe High School in 1936, and enrolled in the free City College in NYC. He decided to transfer to a school that offered an agricultural biology course, and wished to attend the University of Wisconsin. In order to take the specialized courses he wished to have, he first attended Arkansas Tech University, where he studied botany, organic chemistry, and principles of dairying. His success at ATU won him admission to the University of Wisconsin, where he was mentored by Ira Baldwin, the assistant dean of the College of Agriculture. Gottlieb graduated magna cum laude in 1940. His accomplishments at the university, paired with a glowing recommendation from Baldwin, won him admission to the California Institute of Technology, where he received his Doctorate in Biochemistry in June 1943, writing his thesis on \"Studies of Ascorbic Acid in Cowpeas.\"\\nGottlieb met his wife Margaret Moore, daughter of a Presbyterian missionary, while attending CIT, and then they married. Denied the chance of military service, he sought out another way to serve, and began looking for government work in Washington. By 1948, his wife and two daughters were living in a cabin near Vienna, Virginia, that had no electricity or running water. He was living there when he began working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). His lifestyle was in  contrast to that of the Ivy League men the CIA normally recruited.\\n\\n\\n== Government career ==\\nGottlieb\\'s first government position was at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he researched the chemical structure of organic soils. He later transferred to the Food and Drug Administration, where he developed tests to measure the presence of drugs in the human body. Gottlieb grew bored with this work and sought a more challenging position. In 1948, he found a job at the National Research Council, where he described being \"exposed to some interesting work concerning ergot alkaloids as vasoconstrictors and hallucinogens.\" He soon relocated to the University of Maryland as a research associate dedicated to studying metabolisms of fungi.\\nOn July 13, 1951, Gottlieb reported for his first day of work for the CIA. Then-Deputy Director for Operations Allen Dulles hired him on Ira Baldwin\\'s recommendation. Baldwin had founded and run the biowarfare program at Fort Detrick years earlier, and had kept Gottlieb in his orbit. Gottlieb had advanced knowledge about poisons. In the 1950s, Communist infiltration concerned many Americans. These Cold War-era fears also contributed to the CIA expanding its experimental methods over the next two decades, worrying that the USSR and The People\\'s Republic of China had already mastered brainwashing and were using it against their own citizens and prisoners.\\nProject BLUEBIRD was already underway when Gottlieb was brought on board; BLUEBIRD experimented with \"Special Interrogation\" techniques on captured prisoners at black sites like Camp King and Villa Schuster, using drugs to attempt to break ego control and elicit information.

Hundreds of federal agents, field operatives, and scientists worked on these programs before they were shut down in the 1960s.\\n\\n\\n== Results ==\\nOfficial results of these experiments were not released, but accounts from supervisors of the experiments give little insight to the findings. George Hunter White, an agent at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, and Ira \"Ike\" Feldman, a former military intelligence officer, who oversaw San Francisco experiments, noticed that subjects spoke far more freely when under the influence of a combination of drugs and sex. \"No one knows where they [human test subjects] are now, or what effects they may have suffered.\"\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\n\\n=== History ===\\nOperation Midnight Climax started in 1954 and consisted of a web of CIA-run safehouses in San Francisco at 225c Chestnut Street, San Francisco, CA, and Mill Valley, California, as well as New York City. The safehouses were dramatically scaled back in 1963, following a report by CIA Inspector General John Earman which strongly recommended closing the facility. The San Francisco safehouses were closed in 1965, and the New York City safehouse soon followed in 1966. Operation Midnight Climax and Project MKUltra were considered to be so secretive that few people, even in the highest government positions, knew Gottlieb existed, let alone was conducting these experiments. However, some senior officers in the CIA knew enough about him to connect his work to LSD.\\n\\n\\n=== Objectives and methodology ===\\nOperation Midnight Climax was established in order to study the effects of LSD on non-consenting individuals. Prostitutes on the CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safehouses, where they were surreptitiously plied with a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass. The prostitutes were instructed in the use of post-coital questioning to investigate whether the victims could be convinced to involuntarily reveal secrets. The victims were sometimes fed subliminal messages in attempts to induce them to involuntary actions, including criminal activity such as robbery, assault, and assassination. Many of the CIA operatives involved in the experiments voluntarily indulged in the drugs and prostitutes for recreational purposes. Additionally, information from Wilmington News Journal on October 15, 1978, reports from a FOIA request that, \"the spy agency purchased two pounds of Yohimbine hydrochloride... by Dr. Robert V. Lashbrook, the chief aide to Dr. Sidney Gottlieb.\" The role of Dr. Lashbrook was to, \"monitor and approve materials for Operation Midnight Climax.\"\\nSenate investigators were told that the goals of these experiments were to study mind control and sexual behavior. More specifically, to learn about the secrets of brainwashing to gain control over enemy spies and protect U.S. agents. Other objectives included finding drugs that could incapacitate entire buildings via poisoned food, which would create \"confusion-anxiety-fear,\" and other symptoms such as headaches and earaches. These drugs could also have amnesia effects, which were intended for use on foreign spies following interrogations '),\n",

Cameron was born on December 24, 1901, in Scotland and graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1924. In 1929 he moved to Canada where he worked in the Brandon Mental Hospital in Manitoba as the physician in charge. In 1938 he received his diploma in psychiatry and became professor of neurology, psychiatry at University at Albany and began his research on sensory deprivation and memory.\\nIn 1953 he developed his theory of \"psychic driving\" to cure schizophrenia which he later used on his patients under the Project MKUltra, with the codename \"Subproject 68\" for which he was recruited by the CIA in 1957. He was paid $69,000 through the front company \"Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology\" from 1957 to 1964 to carry out these experiments, as well as receiving \"more than $500,000 between 1950 and 1965\" from the federal government. He suddenly left the project four years before the end of his contract.\\nIn 1961 he became president of the World Psychiatric Association after he had already been the president of both the American Psychiatric Association as well as the Canadian Psychiatric Association.\\nIn 1967 he died of a heart attack.\\n\\n\\n== Treatment ==\\nWith the goal of inducing lifelong changes in humans, Cameron used different methods of depatterning and repatterning the brain. The procedures included psychic driving, drug-induced sleep, intensive electroconvulsive therapy, sensory deprivation and the administration of neuroleptic Thorazine.\\nDrug-Induced Sleep\\nCameron used doses of thorazine to put patients into an artificial coma.\\nThe drug-induced sleep, which took place in the \"sleep room\", usually lasted from a few days up to 86 days; longer than expected by the patients. Cameron often combined the sleep periods with injections of hallucinogenic drugs (e.g. LSD), as well as administration of electroshocks and the playing of pre-recorded messages into patients\\' ears.\\nElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)\\n\\nElectroconvulsive therapy (also called electroshock therapy) is a procedure used to treat psychological disorders like treatment-resistant depression.\\nAnother way of depatterning the brain was intensive electroconvulsive therapy (electroshock therapy). Usually, 2 to 3 daily sessions were ordered, consisting of six 150-Volt shocks that lasted one second. After 30-40 daily sessions, Cameron progressively reduced the sessions and finished the treatment after a two-year follow up p'),\n",

Authored by Seymour M. Hersh, it documented an intelligence operation against the anti-war movement, as well as \"break-ins, wiretapping and the surreptitious inspection of mail\" conducted since the 1950s. According to former CIA Official Cord Meyer, these disclosures \"Convinced large sections of the American public that the CIA had become a domestic Gestapo and stimulated an overwhelming demand for the wide-ranging congressional investigations that were to follow.\"\\nHersh had been tipped off to the possibility of an \"in house operation\" by an unidentified member of the CIA in spring of 1974. He embarked on an investigation, speaking to sources that included CIA Chief of Counterintelligence James Angleton. Although he was not aware of its existence, Hersh uncovered much information that had been documented in the \"Family Jewels\", a report ordered by Director of Central Intelligence William Colby that chronicled CIA abuses over the past 25 years. The report would not be formally revealed to the public until 2007.\\n\\n\\n=== Monitoring of anti-war movement and Project MINARET ===\\n\\nThe article alleged that CIA agents had followed and photographed participants in the antiwar movement, as well as other demonstrations. It also reported that the CIA \"set up a network of informants who were ordered to penetrate antiwar groups\", and even placed an avowedly anti-war congressperson under surveillance while putting other lawmakers in a dossier on dissident Americans.\\nInstituted in 1967 by the NSA, Project MINARET\\'s purpose was to document \"Soviet, Chinese, and North Vietnamese influence over the militant civil rights and anti–Vietnam War movements\" for the CIA and FBI, according to historian Donald Critchlow. The NSA provided CIA and FBI officials  with reports of intercepted international communications by certain individuals in these movements. NSA officials stipulated that FBI and CIA agents must destroy or return these reports within two weeks of receiving them. The NSA also required that \"the reports not be \\'identified with the National Security Agency\\' and that all records relating to this program were \\'not serialize[d]\\' or filed with other NSA records, were classified \\'Top Secret,\\' and were stamped \\'Background Use Only\\'... because the'),\n",

In casual speech, \"brainwashing\" and its verb form, \"brainwash\", are used figuratively to describe the use of propaganda to sway public opinion.\\n\\n\\n== China and the Korean War ==\\n\\nThe Chinese term xǐnǎo (traditional Chinese: 洗腦; simplified Chinese: 洗脑 lit.\\u2009\\'wash brain\\') was originally used by early 20th century Chinese intellectuals to refer to modernizing one\\'s way of thinking. The term was later used to describe the coercive persuasion used under the Maoist government in China, which aimed to transform \"reactionary\" people into \"right-thinking\" members of the new Chinese social system. The term punned on the Taoist custom of \"cleansing/washing the heart/mind\" (Chinese: 洗心; pinyin: xǐxīn) before conducting ceremonies or entering holy places.\\nThe earliest known English-language usage of the word \"brainwashing\" in an article by a journalist Edward Hunter, in Miami News, published in 1950. Hunter was an anticommunist and worked for the CIA. Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the Korean War (1950–1953), some American prisoners of war (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, and even in a few cases defected to their side. British radio operator Robert W. Ford and British army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their imprisonment.\\nThe U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including biological warfare. After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote Frank Schwable, Chief of Staff of the First Marine Air Wing admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander General Mark W. Clark asserted: \"Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want ... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.\"\\nBeginning in 1953, Robert Jay Lifton interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the Korean War as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton\\'s 1961 book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of \"Brainwashing\" in China, was based on this research.) Lifton found that when the POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of \"brainwashing.\"\\nIn 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prison'),\n",

Eisenhower\\'s Secretary of State and chairman and senior partner of Sullivan & Cromwell, and two years older than his sister, the diplomat Eleanor Lansing Dulles. His maternal grandfather, John W. Foster, was Secretary of State under Benjamin Harrison, while his uncle by marriage, Robert Lansing was Secretary of State under Woodrow Wilson. Growing up in a parsonage, Dulles was made to attend church daily. As his parents distrusted public education, Dulles was homeschooled by various private tutors.\\nDulles graduated from Princeton University, where he participated in the American Whig–Cliosophic Society. He taught school in India before entering the diplomatic service in 1916. In 1920, he married Martha \"Clover\" Todd (March 5, 1894 – April 15, 1974).

Later in life Dulles said he had been telephoned by Vladimir Lenin, seeking a meeting with the American embassy on April 8, 1917, the day before Lenin left Switzerland to travel to Saint Petersburg aboard a German train. After recovering from the Spanish flu he was assigned to the American delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, along with his elder brother Foster. \\nIn 1921, while at the US Embassy in Istanbul, he helped expose The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as a forgery. Dulles unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the US State Department to publicly denounce the forgery.\\nFrom 1922 to 1926, Dulles served as chief of the Near East division of the Department of State. He then earned a law degree from George Washington University Law School and took a job at Sullivan & Cromwell, the New York firm where his brother, John Foster Dulles, was a partner.

The use of nonlethal chemicals to render an enemy force incapable of fighting dates back to at least 600 B.C. when Solon\\'s soldiers threw hellebore roots into streams supplying water to enemy troops, who then developed diarrhea. In 184 B.C., Hannibal\\'s army used belladonna plants to induce disorientation, and the Bishop of Münster in A.D. 1672 attempted to use belladonna-containing grenades in an assault on the city of Groningen.\\nIn 1881, members of a French railway surveying expedition crossing Tuareg territory in North Africa ate dried dates that tribesmen had apparently deliberately contaminated with Egyptian henbane (Hyoscyamus muticus, or H. falezlez), to devastating effect. In 1908, 200 French soldiers in Hanoi became delirious and experienced hallucinations after being poisoned with a related plant. More recently, accusations of Soviet use of incapacitating agents internally and in Afghanistan were never substantiated.\\n\\n\\n=== The 20th century ===\\nFollowing World War II, the United States military investigated a wide range of possible nonlethal, psychobehavioral, chemical incapacitating agents to include psychedelic indoles such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) and the tetrahydrocannabinol derivative DMHP, certain tranquilizers, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. One of the anticholinergic compounds, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, was assigned the NATO code \"BZ\" and was weaponized beginning in the 1960s for possible battlefield use. (Although BZ figured prominently in the plot of the 1990 movie, Jacob\\'s Ladder, as the compound responsible for hallucinations and violent deaths in a fictitious American battalion in Vietnam, this agent never saw operational use.)

In addition, the scope of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952 that asked, \"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?\"\\nProject Artichoke was the Central Intelligence Agency\\'s secret code name for carrying out in-house and overseas experiments using LSD, hypnosis and total isolation as forms of physiological harassment for special interrogations on human subjects. At first agents used cocaine, marijuana, heroin, peyote and mescaline, but they increasingly saw LSD as the most promising drug. The subjects who left this project were fogged with amnesia, resulting in faulty and vague memories of the experience. In 1952, unknowing CIA agents were secretly drugged to determine the drug\\'s effects on unsuspecting people. One record states that an agent was kept on LSD for 77 days.\\nArtichoke researched the potential of dengue fever and other diseases. A declassified Artichoke memo read: \"Not all viruses have to be lethal… the objective includes those that act as short-term and long-term incapacitating agents.\"\\nThe CIA disputed which department would take over the operation. Finally, it was decided that an agent from the CIA research staff, former U.S. Army brigadier general Paul F. Gaynor, would oversee it. The CIA sought to establish control over what it perceived as the \"weaker\" and \"less intelligent\" segments of society, or for potential agents, defectors, refugees, prisoners of war and others. A CIA report states that if hypnosis succeeded, assassins could be created to assassinate \"a prominent [redacted] politician or if necessary, [an] American official.\" The overseas operations took place in locations throughout Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Teams were assembled to manage these operations and they were told to \"conduct at the overseas bases operational experiments utilizing an alien as a subject.\"\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCIA activities in the United States\\nFrank Olson\\nMKUltra\\nMKNAOMI\\nMKOFTEN\\nProject CHATTER\\nUnethical human experimentation in the United States\\n\\n\\n== Footnotes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nMaret, Susan (2018-02-16). \"Murky Projects and Uneven Information Policies: A Case Study of the Psychological Strategy Board and CIA\".

The primary topic of the Montauk Project concerns the alleged activities at Montauk Point. These center on topics including United States government/military experiments in fields such as time travel, teleportation, mind control, contact with extraterrestrial life, and staging faked Apollo Moon landings, framed as developments that followed the 1943 Philadelphia Experiment.\\nBoth Peter Moon and Preston Nichols have encouraged speculation about the contents; for example, they wrote, \"Whether you read this as science fiction or non-fiction you are in for an amazing story\" in their first chapter, describing much of the content as \"soft facts\" in a Guide For Readers and publishing a newsletter with updates to the story.\\nThe work has been characterized as fiction, because the entire account was fabricated by Preston Nichols, and to some extent, Stewart Swerdlow, who has consistently been shown to contradict his own backstory, and it does appear as if Swerdlow just wanted to become famous in the New Age Community, and establish a reputation for himself. \\n\\n\\n== In media ==\\nIn 2015, Montauk Chronicles, a film adaptation of the conspiracy featuring Preston Nichols, Alfred Bielek, and Stewart Swerdlow, was released online and on DVD and Blu-ray.

The procedure was pioneered by Donald Ewen Cameron, and used and funded by the CIA's Project MKUltra program in Canada.\\n\\n\\n== Psychiatry and MKUltra ==\\nThe psychic driving procedure was a chronological precursor to Cameron's depatterning, the latter involving massive doses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with similarly large doses of psychedelic drugs (such as LSD). The intent was to break down the subject's personality—theoretically psychic driving could then be used with some efficacy in establishing a new personality. In Cameron's depatterning, the ECT would often continue to be administered despite the manifestation of convulsive fits, which were consensually considered to be contraindications to normal and safe ECT procedure. Such biologically and psychologically devastating procedures, adopted internationally by the psychiatric establishment, were largely abolished by the time the CIA was brought before a Senate Hearing (1977) for its involvement and funding of Cameron's experimental activities—as part of the MKULTRA program. The topic of Cameron's psychic driving is dealt with in some detail in the docudrama entitled The Sleep Room (1998) directed by Anne Wheeler.\\n\\n\\n== Other uses ==\\nSimilar techniques are alleged to have been used in the kidnapping and death of CIA operative William Francis Buckley by Aziz al-Abub, a medical doctor from Beirut who was seen as epitomizing medical torture. Aziz al-Abub, also known as Ibrahim al-Nadhir, was known for using his medical training to refine torture techniques. His techniques were shown to be closely connected to the CIA-developed torture techniques. As with the CIA, he used drugs to make it easier to handle those he tortured, carefully determined how long to keep a prisoner hooded and when to isolate them and other techniques seen as medical torture.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nInitially, in the NBC TV series Hannibal, Dr. Chilton uses psychic driving on a patient of the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Dr. Abel Gideon (played by Eddie Izzard), to convince him that he is the main antagonist of the series, the Chesapeake Ripper. Later in the series, psychic driving is alluded to by the main character Dr. Hannibal Lecter as a means to convince FBI profiler Will Graham that he has committed a string of brutal murders during a bout of encephalitis, to throw him off the trail and keep himself safe. Dr. Lecter uses psychic driving by purposely inducing trance-like states during a therapy session, using Will Graham's encephalitis, then reinforcing his delusions that he has killed during episodes of lost time where he cannot remember his own actions.\\nAaron Dilloway's 2010 album Psychic Driving Tapes is based on the concept, and heavily utilizes tape loops in its composition.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nThe Men Who Stare At Goats\\nWilliam Sargant\\nBehavior modification\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nAnne Collins (2002-06-12).

In 2003 the book was listed on the BBC\\'s The Big Read poll of the UK\\'s 200 \"best-loved novels.\"\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nThe book is narrated by Chief Bromden, a gigantic half-Native American patient at a psychiatric hospital, who presents himself as deaf, mute, and docile. Bromden\\'s tale focuses mainly on the antics of the rebellious Randle Patrick McMurphy, who faked insanity to serve his sentence for battery and gambling in the hospital rather than at a prison work farm. The head administrative nurse, Nurse Ratched, rules the ward with absolute authority and little medical oversight.  She is assisted by her three day-shift orderlies and her assistant nurses.\\nMcMurphy constantly antagonizes Nurse Ratched and upsets the routines of the ward, leading to endless power struggles between the inmate and the nurse. He runs a card table, captains the ward\\'s basketball team, comments on Nurse Ratched\\'s figure, incites the other patients to conduct a vote about watching the World Series on television, and organizes a deep-sea fishing trip wherein the patients were going to be \"supervised\" by his prostitute friends. After claiming to be able, and subsequently failing, to lift a heavy control panel in the defunct hydrotherapy room (referred to as the \"tub room\"), his response—\"But at least I tried\"—gives the men incentive to try to stand up for themselves, instead of allowing Nurse Ratched to take control of every aspect of their lives.  The Chief opens up to McMurphy, revealing late one night that he can speak and hear. A violent disturbance after the fishing trip results in McMurphy and the Chief being sent for electroshock therapy sessions, but such punishment does nothing to curb McMurphy\\'s rambunctious behavior.\\nOne night, after bribing the night orderly, McMurphy smuggles two prostitute girlfriends with liquor onto the ward and breaks into the pharmacy for codeine cough syrup and unnamed psychiatric medications. McMurphy, having noticed on the fishing trip that Billy Bibbit—a timid, boyish patient with a stutter and little experience with women—had a crush on the prostitute named Candy, primarily arranged this break-in so that Billy could lose his virginity and, to a slightly lesser extent, so that McMurphy and other patients could throw an unsanctioned party. Although McMurphy agrees before the end of the night to a plan involving his escaping before the morning shift starts, he and the other patients instead fall asleep without cleaning up the mess of the group\\'s antics, and the morning staff discover the ward in complete disarray. Nurse Ratched finds Billy and the prostitute in each other\\'s arms, partially dressed, and admonishes him. Billy asserts himself for the first time, answering Nurse Ratched without stuttering.  Ratched calmly threatens to tell Billy\\'s mother what she has seen.  Billy has an emotional breakdown, regressing immediately back to a boyish state, and, upon being left alone in the doctor\\'s office, takes his life by cutting his throat. Nurse Ratched blames McMurphy for the loss of Billy\\'s life. Enraged at what she has done to Billy, McMurphy attacks Ratched by ripping her shirt open and attempting to strangle her to death. McMurphy is physically restrained and moved to the Disturbed ward.\\nNurse Ratched misses a week of work due to her injuries, during which time many of the patients either transfer to other wards or che'),\n",

According to scholars, there is no credible evidence for O\\'Brien\\'s claims and there are numerous inconsistencies in her story.\\n\\n\\n== Conspiracy theories ==\\nIn Trance Formation of America, O\\'Brien claims that, as a child, she was sexually abused first by her father and then by a network of child pornographers. Supposedly, she was then forced by the CIA to participate in Project Monarch, which she claims is a subsection of Project MKUltra and Project ARTICHOKE. According to O\\'Brien, under hypnosis she was able to recall memories of sexual abuse—of both herself and her daughter—by international pedophile rings, drug barons, and satanists, who allegedly used a form of \"trauma based mind control programming\" to make her a sex slave.\\nO\\'Brien accuses a wide range of prominent people—from American, Canadian, Mexican, and Saudi Arabian government officials to stars of the country music scene—of being part of a Project Monarch conspiracy to operate sex slave rings and commit child abuse. For example, O\\'Brien claims that George H. W. Bush and Miguel de la Madrid used holograms to appear to her in altered forms, saying, \"Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like \\'alien,\\' which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes.

O\\'Brien\\'s Trance Formation of America has been credited as originating \"one of the most significant\" and \"extreme\" mind control conspiracy theories, and her claim of links between satanic ritual abuse and MKUltra have influenced popular conspiracy culture.\\nReligious and political scholars have criticized O\\'Brien\\'s claims for lacking any supporting evidence. David G. Robertson characterized them as symptomatic of \"baseless\" moral panic and wrote that \"no-one has ever been prosecuted of such crimes nor has any corroborating material evidence ever been produced\". According to scholar Michael Barkun, \"scholarly and journalistic treatments of MKUltra make no mention of a Project Monarch\". Barkun describes O\\'Brien\\'s account as \"sensational even by the standards of conspiracy literature\" and notes that even black helicopter conspiracy theorist Jim Keith considered it \"fraudulent or delusional\". Jodi Dean cited O\\'Brien\\'s claims as an example of conspiracy theorists\\' \"leaps in imagination and willingness to deviate from common sense\".\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nO\\'Brien self-publishes her books.\\n\\nO\\'Brien, Cathy; Phillips, Mark (1995).

The program, conducted without consent, used methods like administering high doses of LSD, hypnosis, electroshock, sensory deprivation, and other forms of abuse. It violated individual rights and has been widely condemned as a grave abuse of power.\\nOperating through the CIA\\'s Office of Scientific Intelligence and front organizations, MKUltra involved over 80 institutions, including universities, hospitals, and prisons, often using unwitting subjects in the U.S. and Canada. It was revealed in 1975 by the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission, though investigations were hindered by the destruction of most records in 1973. A 1977 FOIA request uncovered 20,000 documents, leading to Senate hearings. Some details were declassified in 2001.\\n\\n\\n== Domestic wiretapping ==\\n\\nIn 1969, at the height of the antiwar movement in the US, CIA Director Helms received a message from Henry Kissinger ordering him to spy on the leaders of the groups requesting a moratorium on Vietnam. \"Since 1962, three successive presidents had ordered the director of central intelligence to spy on Americans.\"\\n\\n\\n== Extraordinary rendition ==\\n\\nExtraordinary rendition is the apprehension and extrajudicial transfer of a person from one country to another.\\nThe term \"torture by proxy\" is used by some critics to describe situations in which the CIA and other US agencies have transferred suspected terrorists to countries known to employ torture, whether they meant to enable torture or not. It has been claimed, though, that torture has been employed with the knowledge or acquiescence of US agencies (a transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law), although Condoleezza Rice (then the United States Secretary of State) stated that:\\n\\nthe United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.\\nWhilst the Obama administration has tried to distance itself from some of the harshest counterterrorism techniques, it has also said that at least some forms of renditions will continue. The administration continued to allow rendition only \"to a country with jurisdiction over that individual (for prosecution of that individual)\" when there is a diplomatic assurance \"that they will not be treated inhumanely.\"\\nThe US program has also prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states. A June 2006 report from the Council of Europe estimated 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory (with the cooperation of Council of Europe members), and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres (\"black sites\") used by'),\n",

She is primarily portrayed by British actress Millie Bobby Brown. Eleven has psychokinetic and telepathic abilities. After being adopted by chief of police Jim Hopper, her legal name becomes Jane Hopper.\\n\\n\\n== Fictional character biography ==\\nBorn Jane Ives, Eleven is the daughter of Teresa \"Terry\" Ives, and a participant in the Project MKUltra experiments conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Eleven appears to have been born a psychic with notable telekinetic and extrasensory abilities. However, when she uses these abilities to a significant degree, she becomes temporarily weakened and her nose bleeds. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised as a test subject at Hawkins National Laboratory in order to develop her psychokinetic skills. When placed in a sensory deprivation tank, she can use remote viewing to access other dimensions, primarily for the purposes of espionage. In addition, Eleven can open and close portals, known as “Gates”, to a parallel dimension called the Upside Down.\\n\\n\\n=== Season 1 ===\\n\\nIn the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins National Laboratory wearing only her hospital gown and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. The owner Benny takes pity on her and calls social services while putting her in a long t-shirt associated with the restaurant. The responding social worker, who turns out to be an agent sent from Hawkins Laboratory, kills Benny. Eleven then flees before she can be taken again. She is encountered by Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), who are looking for their missing friend Will Byers (Noah Schnapp). The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short and allows Eleven to live in his basement while providing her with some new clothes. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults so Dr. Brenner, whom she calls “Papa” and the people that work for him called “Bad Men”, cannot find her.\\nEleven helps to locate Will and determines that he is trapped in a parallel dimension, which the children dub the \"Upside Down\", where he is being hunted by a creature called the \"Demogorgon\". The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes they are being led toward Hawkins Laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her; she ends up knocking him unconscious and fleeing. She later steals Eggo waffles from a grocery store and eats them in the forest. Mike and Dustin are later threatened by bullies (whom Eleven calls \"mouth breathers\"); Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a lake while Dustin is held hostage. Eleven returns and intervenes before Mike hits the water, frightening the bullies and saving both Mike and Dustin.\\nEleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends. They travel to the town junkyard with Dr. Brenner and his associates in close pursuit. During the chase, a government van catches up to the children; Eleven uses her powers to flip the van through the air, blocking the convoy\\'s path and allowing the group to flee. They are then joined by Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), Hawkins police chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour), Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), and Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton). Together, they create a makeshift isolation tank with a pool and bags of salt in order to help Eleven access the Upside Down. Eleven, using her powers, confirms that Will is alive, but says that Barb, Nancy\\'s friend taken shortly after Will, is “gone”. As government forces close in on the school, Mike tells Eleven she can be a part of his family; he then asks her to the school dance, and kisses her after struggling to explain his')]"
